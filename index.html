          <p>
            Explore worlds beyond imagination - lands filled with wonder,
            challenges, and mysteries waiting to be uncovered. You step into the
            shoes of heroes and adventurers, face fears, solve puzzles, and
            connect with characters who grow with you along the way.

          <img src="media/tetris-wide.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Challenge ourselves not only towards the obstacles on the screen but
            also parts of yourself. Every level is a test of patience, skill,
            and resilience, pushing you to learn from failure and try again. You
            face puzzles, often finding unexpected solutions and new
            perspectives. In many ways this approach mimics real life and that's
            probably why we love games.

          <img src="media/outer-wilds-wide.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            We get inspired to connect with the world around us in new ways and
            see life as an adventure filled with allies, quests, and endless
            possibilities. Games remind us of the power of imagination, the
            beauty of make-believe worlds, and the impact this can have on our
            perspectives. We like games because they give us a chance to
            interact with the game creators vision.

          <h1>Face our fears</h1>
          <img src="media/litte-nightmares-wide.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Scary games is it's genre, just like scary movies. Why do we like
            them? Because they let us confront our fears in a controlled, safe
            environment. Horror games tap into our adrenaline, waking us up to a
            primal sense of excitement and urgency. But it's more than just a
            thrill; they give us a chance to face the unknown and come out
            braver, stronger, and with a story to tell.

          <h1>Play with others</h1>
          <img src="media/it-takes-two-wide.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Collaboration is an integral part of playing games. It's in these
            shared moments of strategy, support, and teamwork that we discover
            the true power of connection. Together, we solve problems, cover
            each other's weaknesses, and celebrate victories that feel bigger
            because they're shared. Games teach us that everyone brings
            something unique to the table, and it's through combining those
            strengths that we can overcome even the toughest challenges.

          <img src="media/street-fighter-6-wide.jpg" alt="" />
          <p>
            Competition is an interesting part of playing games. It transforms
            individual play into something greater — a shared experience where
            skills, strategy, and communication come to life. When we team up,
            we're not just players on a screen; we're allies, strategizing,
            adapting, and learning from one another. Games show us that each
            player brings a unique strength, and together we can achieve things
            we'd never accomplish alone.

          <p>
            Remember when you first played a game that gripped you? So do we.
            That's how Gamehub got started—a group of kids who grew up but never
            outgrew the magic of video games. We couldn't let go of the thrill,
            the wonder, and the endless worlds waiting to be explored. For us,
            gaming isn't just a pastime; it's a place where stories come to
            life, where challenges transform us, and where friendships grow
            stronger with every level conquered. Sometimes, just being in the
            game is enough, isn't it?
